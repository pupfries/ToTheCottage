 A text-based CYOA game, personal project by a beginner

This is meant to be a multiple-choice, text-based choose-your-own-adventure game. 
I'm new to python and coding in general, not even yet done reading the book which is teaching me. 
I wanted to make a CYOA game with what I have learned so far and I'm sure there are lots of mistakes.


How I wanted it to work:
The premise of the game is that a character wakes up in the forest and has to find their way home to their cottage.
There are many multiple-choice options to find one's way home, some of which kill the player.

There are 2 items in the game (flower and hat) which collecting can change the outcome of the game.
I wanted to make it so that the player could choose to replay the game at the end of their playthrough.
I also wanted to give and display achievements at the end of the playthrough as well as which "ending" the player got.
